== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Can I import events without a Meetup API key? =  
Yes! You can import Meetup events directly without needing an API key or any authorization. There’s no requirement for a Meetup Pro account, just choose your import method and start importing instantly.

= Does this plugin work with my event calendar plugin? =  
Yes! Import Meetup Events supports popular event plugins including The Events Calendar, Events Manager, Event Organiser, EventON, My Calendar, or you can use the built-in event system.

= Does this plugin work with The Events Calendar? =  
Yes! It integrates seamlessly with The Events Calendar (by StellarWP), including support for the latest version 6.x. Imported events appear natively in TEC calendar views, categories, and search.

= Can I import events automatically on a schedule? =  
Automatic scheduled imports are available in the **[Pro version](https://xylusthemes.com/plugins/import-meetup-events/)**. You can configure hourly, twice-daily, daily, or weekly sync intervals. The free version supports one-click manual imports.

= What happened to the old Meetup API key method? =  
Meetup.com deprecated their legacy API keys in 2019 and migrated to OAuth 2.0. This plugin fully supports the new OAuth 2.0 authorization flow. See our [setup guide](https://xylusthemes.com/how-to-create-meetup-oauth-client-for-importing-meetup-events-using-import-meetup-event-wordpress-plugin/) for step-by-step instructions.

= Can I display imported events anywhere on my site? =  
Absolutely. You can use the shortcode `[meetup_events]`, Gutenberg block, Elementor widget, WPBakery Page Builder element, or the classic WordPress widget to display events anywhere.

= Can I filter events by Group ID or layout style? =  
Yes! You can filter imported events by Group ID using the shortcode and display them in 4 different grid styles for a clean, modern look (Pro version).

= Does this plugin import event images, venues, and organizer details? =  
Yes. Each import pulls the event title, description, featured image, start/end dates, venue (with address), and organizer information directly from the Meetup.com API.

= Will importing events create duplicate entries? =  
No. The plugin checks for existing events before importing. If an event has already been imported, it will be updated instead of duplicated. This is especially powerful with the Pro version's scheduled sync.

= Is this plugin compatible with WordPress multisite? =  
Yes. The plugin works on both single-site and multisite WordPress installations. The Pro version includes multisite-friendly licensing for agencies.
